  - Basic calculator with simple functionalities
  - Keyboard support included
  - Square Root is the only additional function included

# Challenges
- Creating the basic layout was easy. I had a basic look in mind and I also looked through some images on google to find a layout I liked.
- Implementing it with HTML/CSS was also fairly straightforward. I took more time making the colour selections than with the actual code.
- The JS was the biggest pain in the ass.
  - The first issue was thinking up of all the possible use case scenarios. For this I used pseudocode for the very first time and it definitely helped clear my thought proess with regards to what I wanted my calculator to do.
  - The next issue was how to get the operator buttons functioning. The pseudocode helped in this case as well. The remaining keys were not hard to implement.
  - Then there was the case of the display length. It works to some extent right now. I've seen some of the examples in the showcase and I definitely think my implementation is better than most but not at the level I'm completely happy with. 
  - The last and biggest issue was including keyboard support. I tried googling a lot and even asked on the Discord but couldn't get a satisfactory answer. It took a bit more searching and some trial and error to get the keyboard functioning especially for the operator keys.
